1. Visit the awesome-public-datasets repository. From the list, select one dataset that you find 
interesting. Why do you find this dataset interesting? (Please explain, for example, why it was 
collected and what it could be used for.) 

I chose the data.police.uk repository. This website is for open data about crime and policing in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The website features detailed downloadable data and statistics in the CSV/excel format about individual departments and police forces in these separate countries.  

I found this to be of personal interest because I am interested in the ‚Äúon the ground‚Äù stats about what is happening in different communities regarding crime. Frequently, it seems as if the USA has the most crime around the world, but it may be because we don‚Äôt hear/read about crime in other places. This data set could be used for comparison between comparable western countries for strategic and solution focused ideas for crime prevention. 

The API provides a rich data source for information, including: 

    Neighbourhood team members 

    Upcoming events 

    Street-level crime and outcome data 

    Nearest police stations 

 
2. What information is contained in the metadata of the dataset you selected? What additional 
information would be useful to include in the metadata? 

The information contained in the metadata is : 

    Title: ASB Incidents, Crime and Outcomes 

    Theme: Crime and Criminal Justice 

    Description: Individual crime and anti-social behaviour (ASB) incidents, including street-level location information and subsequent police and court outcomes associated with the crime. 

    Keywords: police, courts, crime, anti-social behaviour 

    Frequency: Monthly 

    Time Period Covered: May 2020 to April 2023 

    Geographic Coverage: England, Wales, Northern Ireland 

    Publisher: Single Online Home National Digital Team 

    licence: Open Government Licence v3.0 

    Language: en-GB 

For privacy reasons, I believe this is more than enough data for an external source to access due to the sensitive nature of the data set.  

 
3. How can the dataset be accessed? Are there any barriers to accessing the data? (Please 
include any noteworthy features of its storage or structure.  

The information is categorized in a downloadable CVS format and is made available under the Open Government Licence v3.0. It is very easy to pull informations, metrics and meta date from the downlaoadable files.  There are not any barirs to acessing this data even though it downloads as read only. 

You can also download data on police activity, and a range of data collected under the police annual data requirement (ADR) including arrests and 101 call handling. 

 
My Chosen topic is  [Wellcomecollection/storage-service](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/storage-service.git). I chose this topic because cloud based storage could be very important to a police/crime statistic repository. They will need to save data in multiple formats.
